Fixed a problem where eventlet monkeypatching was inappropriately installed in child processes which use threads. This would result in certain operations (primarily DNS lookup operations) resulting in a greenlet "cannot switch to another thread" exception.

Changed the paste factory to use 10 worker threads by default, to match the paste default. Previously if the paste ini file did not mention how many worker threads to use, spawning would default to 0 and switch into cooperative, non-blocking mode.

Added a deadman timeout to child processes which have been told to exit and are waiting for outstanding requests to finish. If the timeout expires before all requests have completed, we assume the process is hung and kill -9 it. The default timeout is 120 seconds.

If an i/o child process dies with an exit code other than 0, the controller decides something must have gone horribly wrong and restarts all of the children.

0.8.1: Fix a bug where the reloader didn't work with paster serve.

0.8.2: In the svn reloader, watch both spawning's directory and the directory of the wsgi application we are serving. Also, fix the django_factory which was broken by 0.8.

0.8.3: For all svn repositories the svn reloader is watching, also watch any svn:externals repositories contained therein.
