Fixed a problem where eventlet monkeypatching was inappropriately installed in child processes which use threads. This would result in certain operations (primarily DNS lookup operations) resulting in a greenlet "cannot switch to another thread" exception.

Changed the paste factory to use 8 worker threads by default, to match the paste default. Previously if the paste ini file did not mention how many worker threads to use, spawning would default to 0 and switch into cooperative, non-blocking mode.

Added django_factory.

Add an optional worker processpool which can be used as an equivalent to the worker threadpool.

Added command-line script to launch a wsgi application, 'spawn'.
